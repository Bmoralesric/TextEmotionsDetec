# Text Emotions Detection
Text Emotions Detection with Machine Learning
In machine learning, the detection of textual emotions is the problem of content-based classification, which is the task of natural language processing. Detecting a personâ€™s emotions is a difficult task, but detecting the emotions using text written by a person is even more difficult as a human can express his emotions in any form.

The generated output is superb. This is how we can use machine learning for the task of detecting emotions from the text. This is an important task of human-machine interactions for anyone looking for a future in natural language processing.
